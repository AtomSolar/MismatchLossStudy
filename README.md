# MismatchLossStudy
System level mismatch loss calculator using PVMismatch tool (STC and Annual energy loss)

Differences in the current-voltage characteristics of photovoltaic (PV) modules connected in series and parallel combinations lead to a loss in the system level power referred to as “mismatch loss” or “electrical mismatch loss”.
